## Project Overview
The "SQL Projects" repository includes various SQL tasks and projects completed during the Celebal Technologies Summer Internship. This repository demonstrates the practical application of SQL to address real-world scenarios, including data manipulation, querying, and stored procedure implementation using the Adventure Works Database 2022.


## Installation
To explore or run the SQL queries and stored procedures:
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
   
            https://github.com/jaiswalchitransh/SQL-Projects.git
   
2. Open the SQL scripts in your preferred SQL client, such as Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) or Azure Data Studio.

3. Connect to the Adventure Works Database 2022 if required or set up the database as per the provided instructions.

4. Execute the SQL scripts and stored procedures as described in each task.


## Usage
The repository contains various SQL tasks and implementations:

- **Project 1**: Calculated the total work hours of employees based on their check-in and check-out times.
- **Level A Task**: Executed different queries on the Adventure Works Database 2022.
- **Level B Task**: Executed queries using Stored Procedures, Functions, Views, and Triggers on the Adventure Works Database 2022.
- **Level C Task**: Executed queries according to specific tasks assigned.
- **Student Allotment SQL Problem**: Implemented a stored procedure to assign students to subjects based on a predefined workflow.
- **Subject Change Request Problem**: Implemented a stored procedure to insert requested subjects as valid records in the SubjectAllotments Table according to the specified workflow.


## Features
- **Comprehensive SQL Queries**: Various queries to interact with and manipulate data in the Adventure Works Database 2022.
- **Stored Procedures**: Implementation of stored procedures to handle complex operations and workflows.
- **Database Tasks**: Includes calculations, data retrieval, and management tasks relevant to real-world scenarios.
- **Database Schema**: Utilizes the Adventure Works Database 2022 schema for demonstrating SQL capabilities.
