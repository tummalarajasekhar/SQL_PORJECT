Create a procedure GetOrderDetails that takes OrderlD as input parameter and
returns all the records for that OrderlD. If no records are found in Order Details
table, then it should print the line: "The OrderID XXXX does not exits", where
XXX should be the OrderID entered by user and the procedure should RETURN
the value 1.
