Create a procedure InsertOrderDetails that takes OrderID, ProductID, UnitPrice,
Quantiy, Discount as input parameters and inserts that order information in the
Order Details table. After each order inserted, check the @@rowcount value to
make sure that order was inserted properly. If for any reason the order was not
inserted, print the message: Failed to place the order. Please try again. Also your
procedure should have these functionalities
Make the UnitPrice and Discount parameters optional
If no UnitPrice is given, then use the UnitPrice value from the product table.
If no Discount is given, then use a discount of 0.
Adjust the quantity in stock (UnitsInStock) for the product by subtracting the quantity
sold from inventory.
However, if there is not enough of a product in stock, then abort the stored procedure
without making any changes to the database.
Print a message if the quantity in stock of a product drops below its Reorder Level as a
result of the update.
