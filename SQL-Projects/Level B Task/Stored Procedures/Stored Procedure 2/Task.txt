Create a procedure UpdateOrderDetails that takes OrderlD, ProductID, UnitPrice,
Quantity, and discount, and updates these values for that ProductID in that Order.
All the parameters except the OrderlD and ProductID should be optional so that if
the user wants to only update Quantity s/he should be able to do so without
providing the rest of the values. You need toalso make sure that if any of the values
are being passed in as NULL, then you want to retain the original value instead of
overwriting it with NULL. To accomplish this, look for the ISNULLO function in
google or sql server books online. Adjust the UnitsInStock value in products table
accordingly.
