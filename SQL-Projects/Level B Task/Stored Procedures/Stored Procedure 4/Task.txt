Create a procedure DeleteOrderDetails that takes OrderlD and ProductID and
deletes that from Order Details table. Your procedure should validate parameters.
It should return an error code (-1) and print a message if the parameters are
invalid. Parameters are valid if the given order ID appears in the table and if the
given product ID appears in that order.
