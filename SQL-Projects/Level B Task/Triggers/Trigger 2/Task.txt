When an order is placed for X units of product Y, we must first check the Products
table to ensure that there is sufficient stock to fill the order. This trigger will operate
on the Order Details table. If sufficient stock exists, then fill the order and
decrement X units from the UnitsInStock column in Products. If insufficient stock
exists, then refuse the order (i.e. do not insert it) and notify the user that the order
could not be filled because of insufficient stock.
