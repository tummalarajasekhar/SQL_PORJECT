If someone cancels an order in northwind database, then you want to delete that
order from the Orders table. But you will not be able to delete that Order before
deleting the records from Order Details table for that particular order due to
referential integrity constraints. Create an Instead of Delete trigger on Orders table
so that if some one tries to delete an Order that trigger gets fired and that trigger
should first delete everything in order details table and then delete that order from
the Orders table
